    question: "Why Clera vs other finance apps?",
    answer: `Most finance apps give you generic advice or just aggregate news. Clera is different — we're an SEC-registered investment advisor (CRD #338073), which means we're legally required to act in your best interest.

We provide personalized, actionable guidance based on YOUR financial situation, not one-size-fits-all recommendations. Plus, we can actually help you execute trades and manage your portfolio, not just give opinions.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Why not a human financial advisor?",
    answer: `Human advisors typically charge 1-2% of your assets annually. On a $100,000 portfolio, that's $1,000-$2,000 per year — every year.

Clera provides the same fiduciary-level guidance for just $9.99/month. Plus, we're available 24/7, never take vacations, and don't have conflicts of interest from commission-based products.

For complex situations like estate planning or business finances, we'll always recommend consulting a human specialist.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Clera for?",
    answer: `Clera is perfect for:

• Busy professionals who want to invest but don't have time to research
• First-time investors who feel overwhelmed by options
• Self-directed investors who want a second opinion
• Anyone tired of paying high advisory fees

Whether you're starting with $100 or $100,000, Clera provides personalized guidance tailored to your goals.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Does Clera charge AUM fees like traditional advisors?",
    answer: `No. Never.

Traditional advisors charge 1-2% of your assets under management (AUM) annually. Clera charges one flat fee: $9.99/month. That's it.

No percentage of your assets. No hidden fees. No commissions. As your wealth grows, your cost stays the same.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How is my data protected?",
    answer: `Your security is our top priority:

• 256-bit bank-level encryption for all data
• We never sell your data to third parties
• SOC 2 compliant infrastructure
• Your credentials are never stored — we use secure OAuth connections

As an SEC-registered advisor, we're also subject to strict regulatory requirements for data protection.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I reach out for support?",
    answer: `We're always here to help!

Email us anytime at support@askclera.com

We typically respond within 24 hours, often much faster. Whether you have questions, feedback, or found a bug — don't hesitate to reach out. We genuinely want to hear from you.`,
