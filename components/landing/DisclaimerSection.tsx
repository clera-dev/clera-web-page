    content: `The return rates used in our simulations are based on historical market data and reasonable projections:

• Conservative (6%): Based on a portfolio weighted toward bonds and stable value investments
• Balanced (8%): Based on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, approximating long-term market averages
• Aggressive (10%): Based on a growth-oriented portfolio weighted toward equities

• Average Investor Return (4.05%): Based on DALBAR's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (QAIB) 2023 report, representing the average equity fund investor return over a 3-year period

All returns are presented as annual rates and assume monthly compounding. Returns do not account for taxes, which may significantly impact your actual returns. Real-world performance will differ based on market conditions, timing of investments, and individual circumstances.`,

• Monthly subscription: $9.99/month
• No assets under management (AUM) fees
• No performance fees
• No hidden costs

Third-party costs you may incur separately:
• Brokerage transaction fees (if applicable to your broker)
• Fund expense ratios for ETFs and mutual funds you invest in
• Standard market spreads

Our fee structure is designed to align our interests with yours. Unlike traditional advisors who charge 1-2% of AUM annually, our flat fee means we don't earn more when you invest more—we succeed when you succeed.`,
